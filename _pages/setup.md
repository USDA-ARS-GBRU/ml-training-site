# The tools used in the course

To get everyone up an running quickly with machine learning we rely on
several tools to standardize the software people use.

The first tool is Miniconda. this is a tool that allows users to create an
exact software environment across platforms. and automatically install needed
software packages.

Next We will be using Jupyter notebooks. The notebook is a browser based
integrated development environment (IDE) that allows users to annotate code, run
code in different languages and visualize results.
