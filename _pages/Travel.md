The information on this page is for USDA-ARS participants who have received
invitations to participate by email. Other people interested in taking the
course should visit the [general registration page](/ml-training-site/register).
{: .notice--warning}

*Approval for the training is still officially pending for ARS participants. We will provide official information once the meeting is approved.*

## Dates
The workshop will be from August 27-28 with travel days of the 26 and 29 if you need them.  We anticipate finishing by 17:00 on the 28th so departure that night should be possible for some of you. The workshop will be at the Reitz Union at the University of Florida.

## Travel vouchers
Travel charges are being monitored by USDA and we have to report total expenses, so we would ask that you be prudent on your charges and extremely timely on turning in your travel vouchers.

Please have a copy of the travel authorization and voucher sent to Wendy Smith (<wendy.smith@ars.usda.gov>) with the subject line as “ML-training and your name”.

You will receive an email from Adam Rivers with the subject "ML training travel information" that contains the accounting code for your travel. Your travel arranger will need to put in a portal request to add this code to your profile for this trip.

## Hotel

Please book your room at the Reitz Union Hotel using the group name provided in the email.
