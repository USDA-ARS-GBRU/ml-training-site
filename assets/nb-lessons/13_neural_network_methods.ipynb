    "## Learn deeply\n",
    "[Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) and [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) are currently getting a lot of interest, both as a subject of research and as a tool for analyzing datasets. ANNs are similar to feature crosses, except that thanks to something called [backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation), an ANN is able to choose its own features based on the testing data. A lot of the other advantages of ANNs are related specifically to interpreting visual and auditory data, which we won't be doing today, but I'll point you some resources to learn about [convolutional neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Units\n",
    "\n",
    "ANNs are designed as *layers* of *units* (or nodes, or artificial neurons). Units were initially designed based on how biological neurons function, but they're best thought of as individual *feature-crosses*. Each unit focuses on a particular aspect of the layer underneath it, and then summarizing that information for the layer above it. How does it do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Every unit has a *weight* and a *bias*, and so is effectively doing a linear regression on the incoming data to obtain an output. But doing multiple times will just look for linear relationships in the data. To look for non-linear relationships, we need to add a non-linear function: we feed the output of the unit through an *activation function*.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANNs used to use the same sigmoid function we saw before, but these days the [rectified linear unit (ReLU) function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)) has become much more popular. It simply returns zero when the real output value is less than zero. This non-linearity can be used by the ANN to distinguish data that is not linearly separable.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ReLU and softmax rectifiers](800px-Rectifier_and_softplus_functions.svg.png )\n",
    "\n",
    "### Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "![A diagram showing input, output and hidden layers in an ANN](../nb-images/colored_neural_network.svg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Every neural network has three layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An input layer, where each unit corresponds to a particular input feature. In our example today, this will be various aspects of a forest plot, but it could be categorical data, continuous data, or even colour values from images.\n",
    "* An output layer. In many ANNs, the output layer will consist of a single label. In our example today, we will be classifying each forest plot into one of seven types, and so we will have seven output units, one for each type.\n",
    "* A hidden layer. Without a hidden layer, an ANN could only pick up linear relationships: how changes in the input layer correspond to values in the output layer. Thanks to the hidden layer, an ANN can also pick up non-linear relationships, where different groups of input values need to be treated differently to get the correct response on the output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting it all together, we end up with a type of ANN called a *multilayer perceptron (MLP) network*, which looks like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A visualization of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) from the Scikit-learn manual](../nb-images/multilayerperceptron_network.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Google's Machine Learning course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/introduction-to-neural-networks/anatomy) puts this very nicely: \"Stacking nonlinearities on nonlinearities lets us model very complicated relationships between the inputs and the predicted outputs. In brief, each layer is effectively learning a more complex, higher-level function over the raw inputs.\""

    "### Backpropagation\n",
    "\n",
    "The heart of neural networks is [backpropagation algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation), which are an efficient way to \n",
    "\n",
    "In effect, an ANN is trained by:\n",
    "1. Setting all weights and biases randomly.\n",
    "2. For each row in the test data:\n",
    "    1. Set the input units to the input features.\n",
    "    2. Use unit weights and biases, passing through the activation function, to calculate the output value of each unit -- right through to the output units.\n",
    "    3. Use a loss function to Compare the output units with the expected output\n",
    "    4. Use a backpropagation algorithm to update all the weights and biases to reduce the loss.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Google has a [nice visual explanation](https://google-developers.appspot.com/machine-learning/crash-course/backprop-scroll/) of backpropagation. [More detailed explanations](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html) are also available.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### When backpropagation goes wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "* Vanishing gradients: when weights for lower levels (closer to the input) become very small, gradients become very small too, making it hard or impossible to train these layers. The ReLU activation function can help prevent vanishing gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Exploding gradients: when weights become very large, the gradients for lower layers can become very large, making it hard for these gradients to converge. Batch normalization can help prevent exploding gradients, as can lowering the learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dead ReLU units: once the weighted sum for a ReLU activation function falls below 0, the ReLU unit can get stuck -- without an output, it doesn't contribute to the network output, and gradients can't flow through it in backpropagation. Lowering the learning rate can help keep ReLU units from dying.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dropout regularization: in this form of regularization, a proportion of unit activations are randomly dropped out. This prevents overfitting and so helps create a better model."

    "## So what do we need?\n",
    "To create an ANN, we need to choose:\n",
    "1. The number of input units (= the number of input features)\n",
    "2. The number of output units:\n",
    "    - When we are using the ANN to classify, we generally set the number of output units to the number of possible labels\n",

    "3. The number of hidden layers\n",
    "    - More hidden layers allows for more complex models -- which, as you've learned, also increases your risk of overfitting! So you want to go for the simplest model that meets your needs.\n",

    "5. The regularization protocol\n",
