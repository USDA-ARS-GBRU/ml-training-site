    "## Learning objectives\n",
    "* Understand what an artificial neural network (ANN) is and how it can be used.\n",
    "* Implement ANNs for use in prediction and classification based on multiple input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning deeply\n",
    "[Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) and [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) are currently getting a lot of interest, both as a subject of research and as a tool for analyzing datasets. A big difference from other machine learning techniques we've looked at so far is that ANNs can identify characteristics of interest by themselves, rather than having to be chosen by data scientists. Some of the other advantages of ANNs are related specifically to interpreting video and audio data, such as by using [convolutional neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network), but today we will focus on simple ANNs so you understand their struction and function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Units\n",
    "\n",
    "ANNs are designed as *layers* of *units* (or nodes, or [artificial neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neuron)). Each unit accepts multiple inputs, each of which has a different weight, including one bias input, which it combines into a single value. That single value is passed to an [activation function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function), which provides an output only if the combined value is greater than a particular threshold (usually, zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "In effect, each unit focuses on a particular aspect of the layer underneath it, and then summarizing that information for the layer above it. Every input to every unit has a *weight* and the unit has a *bias* input, and so is effectively doing a linear regression on the incoming data to obtain an output. The use of a non-linear activation function allows the ANN to predict and classify data that are not [linearly separable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_separability). ANNs used to use the same sigmoid function we saw before, but these days the [rectified linear unit (ReLU) function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)) has become much more popular. It simply returns zero when the real output value is less than zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ReLU and softmax rectifiers](800px-Rectifier_and_softplus_functions.svg.png )\n",
    "\n",
    "### Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "![A diagram showing input, output and hidden layers in an ANN](../nb-images/colored_neural_network.svg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Every neural network has three layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An input layer, where each unit corresponds to a particular input feature. This could be categorical data, continuous data, or even colour values from images.\n",
    "* An output layer. We will be running two examples today: in the first, we will use a single output unit (the predicted price for a particular house in California). In the second, we will use seven output units, each corresponding to a particular type of forest cover.\n",
    "* A hidden layer. Without a hidden layer, an ANN can only pick up linear relationships: how changes in the input layer correspond to values in the output layer. Thanks to the hidden layer, an ANN can also pick up non-linear relationships, where different groups of input values interact in complicated ways to get the correct response on the output layer. The \"deep\" in [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) refers to the hidden layers that allow the model to identify intermediate patterns between the input and output layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting it all together, we end up with a type of ANN called a *multilayer perceptron (MLP) network*, which looks like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A visualization of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) from the Scikit-learn manual](../nb-images/multilayerperceptron_network.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Google's Machine Learning course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/introduction-to-neural-networks/anatomy) puts this very nicely: \"Stacking nonlinearities on nonlinearities lets us model very complicated relationships between the inputs and the predicted outputs. In brief, each layer is effectively learning a more complex, higher-level function over the raw inputs.\""

    "## So what do we need?\n",
    "To create an ANN, we need to choose:\n",
    "1. The number of input units (= the number of input features)\n",
    "2. The number of output units:\n",
    "    - When using the ANN to predict, we generally only need a single output unit.\n",
    "    - When using the ANN to classify, we generally set the number of output units to the number of possible labels.\n",
    "3. The number of hidden layers\n",
    "    - More hidden layers allows for more complex models -- which, as you've learned, also increases your risk of overfitting! So you want to go for the simplest model that meets your needs.\n",
    "4. A loss function. The scikit-learn classes we use always use [logistic loss](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.log_loss.html), also known as cross-entropy loss.\n",
    "4. The solver to use. The solver controls learning by searching for local minima in the parameter space. ANNs generally use [stochastic gradient descent (SGD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent) such as [RMSProp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent#RMSProp), but today we will use [Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent#Adam).\n",
    "5. The regularization protocol. We will use L2 regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that these are the [hyperparameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_(machine_learning)) of our model: we will adjust these hyperparameters to improve how quickly and accurately we can determine the actual parameters of our model, which is the set of weights and biases on all units across all layers."

    "The input data comes in many different ranges: compare the ranges of latitude (32.54 to 41.95), longitude (-124.35 to -114.31), median income (0.50 to 15.0) and population (3 to 35682). As we described earlier, it's a good idea to normalize these values. Scikit-Learn has several built-in scalers that do just this. We will use the [StandardScaler](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html), which changes the data so it is normally distributed, with a mean of 0 and a variance of 1, but other [standardization methods are available](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html#standardization-or-mean-removal-and-variance-scaling)."

    "\n",
    "In effect, an ANN is trained by:\n",
    "1. Setting all weights and biases randomly.\n",
    "2. For each row in the test data:\n",
    "    1. Set the input units to the input features.\n",
    "    2. Use unit weights and biases, passing through the activation function, to calculate the output value of each unit -- right through to the output units.\n",
    "    3. Use a loss function to Compare the output units with the expected output\n",
    "    4. Use a backpropagation algorithm to update all the weights and biases to reduce the loss.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Google has a [nice visual explanation](https://google-developers.appspot.com/machine-learning/crash-course/backprop-scroll/) of backpropagation. [More detailed explanations](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html) are also available.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### When backpropagation goes wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "* Vanishing gradients: when weights for lower levels (closer to the input) become very small, gradients become very small too, making it hard or impossible to train these layers. The ReLU activation function can help prevent vanishing gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Exploding gradients: when weights become very large, the gradients for lower layers can become very large, making it hard for these gradients to converge. Batch normalization can help prevent exploding gradients, as can lowering the learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dead ReLU units: once the weighted sum for a ReLU activation function falls below 0, the ReLU unit can get stuck -- without an output, it doesn't contribute to the network output, and gradients can't flow through it in backpropagation. Lowering the learning rate can help keep ReLU units from dying.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dropout regularization: in this form of regularization, a proportion of unit activations are randomly dropped out. This prevents overfitting and so helps create a better model."
