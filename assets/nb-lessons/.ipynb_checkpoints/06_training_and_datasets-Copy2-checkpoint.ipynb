    "Main goal in the statistical or machine learning model is to biuld a generalized predictive-model. Often we start with a set of data to build a model and describe the model fit and other properties. However, it is equally important to test the model with new data (the data that has not been used in fitting a model), and check the model performace. From agricultural perspective, basically we need to run an additional experiment to generate a data for purpose of model validation. Instead what we can do is to __randomly__ divide the a single dataset into two parts, and use one part for the purpose of learnign whereas the other part for testing the model performacne.\n",
