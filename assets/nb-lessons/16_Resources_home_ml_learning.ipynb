    "Hopefully this two day course have given you a good sense of what machine learning is, the key concepts in the field and the range of methods used.  Out goal is to launch you to become a consumer of machine learning methods to further your research. In this section we wanted to prove your with links to resources than will help you continue to learning about machine learning.\n",
