The transformer object holds information about the methods of transformation. Fitting the transformer sets the values used in the transformation and calling the transform method applies that transformation to the data.  That data can be the original training data or new data that needs to be classified. \n"

IF the feature space is not too large the distribution of of each variable can show outliers. Reduced representations of data such as PCA can show outliers in high dimension data sets. There are a number of tools for cleaning data one of the easiet to use is [Open Refine](http://openrefine.org/).

    "This looks better but the center is around 100 and the data is a bit skewed.  Many learning methods perform better when the data is more symmetrical and scaled similarly across features.  So lets try applying a **_standardization_** to our data. \n",

    "In practice we often ignore the shape of the distribution and just transform the data to center it by removing the mean value of each feature, then scale it by dividing non-constant features by their standard deviation.\n",

    "For instance, many elements used in the objective function of a learning algorithm (such as the RBF kernel of Support Vector Machines or the l1 and l2 regularizers of linear models) assume that all features are centered around zero and have variance in the same order. If a feature has a variance that is orders of magnitude larger than others, it might dominate the objective function and make the estimator unable to learn from other features correctly as expected.\n",
