    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the programming language [Python](https://www.python.org/) for all lessons in this workshop.  Because we don't have enough time to give a complete, from-scratch introduction to programming, we are assuming that even if you've not used Python before, you have some experience with at least one so-called \"scripting\" programming language, such as R or MATLAB.  You really don't need to know very much of Python for this workshop, so in this first lesson, we'll cover the most important bits of Python and also introduce two Python packages that are commonly used for doing machine learning with Python, _NumPy_ and _pandas_.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Introducing Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to run Python programs.  For general scripting and programming tasks, it is common to run Python programs directly from the command line, much as you would any other piece of software.  However, for this workshop, we will be using a programming environment called [*Jupyter notebooks*](https://jupyter.org/) that allows you to run Python programs one line (or several lines) at a time and inspect the results at each step.  This approach to programming is especially well suited for data analysis work and will be familiar to you if you've used R programming environments such as RStudio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are comprised of _cells_ that contain either Python code or text.  To run the code in a cell, click in the cell to make it active, then type `shift+enter`.  The results from running the Python code will be displayed below the cell.  Typing `shift+enter` will also open a new cell below the active cell if there is not already a cell there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll try using a Jupyter notebook to learn some basic Python commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Python basics\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's look at how we can write literal values in Python.  Numbers are written just as you'd expect; for example, `12` or `3.141592654`.  Literal text values are called _strings_ and are enclosed in either single or double quotes: `'this is a string'` or `\"this is a string\"`.\n",

    "Python code is often organized into units called _packages_ and _modules_.  Although there are technical differences between the two, for the purposes of this workshop, we can think of them as functionally the same (to avoid typing \"module or package\" over and over, I'll sometimes use the term \"library\" to refer to both).  Modules and packages group together related code and make it easy to reuse that code in other programs.  To introduce the basic concepts, we'll work with a standard Python module called `math` that contains a variety of mathematical functions.\n",

Let's take a look at how we can access them."

Although we've covered only a tiny fraction of what these tools can do, you should at least be able to begin using them for basic data manipulation tasks.  Upcoming lessons will introduce more features of these tools, as well as give you plenty of opportunity to practice using them."
